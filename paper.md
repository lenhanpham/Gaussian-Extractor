# Summary

Gaussian-Extractor is a high-performance, cluster-safe software tool designed for efficient processing of Gaussian computational chemistry output files. The software addresses the critical need for automated, parallel processing of large datasets generated by quantum chemical calculations, providing researchers with comprehensive data extraction, job status monitoring, and thermodynamic analysis capabilities. Built with modern C++20, Gaussian-Extractor implements multi-threaded processing with sophisticated resource management to ensure stable operation in shared computing environments including SLURM, PBS, SGE, and LSF clusters.

The software excels in extracting thermodynamic properties (Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, entropies), monitoring job completion status, calculating high-level electronic energies with thermal corrections, and generating Gaussian input files from molecular coordinates. Its cluster-aware design automatically detects available resources and implements safety mechanisms to prevent system overload, making it particularly suitable for high-throughput computational chemistry workflows. Gaussian-Extractor supports both Linux and Windows platforms, offering command-line interface and interactive modes to accommodate diverse user preferences and computing environments.

# Statement of Need

Computational chemistry has become an indispensable tool in modern chemical research, with Gaussian being one of the most widely used quantum chemistry software packages [@gaussian16; @gaussian09]. However, the practical application of computational chemistry often involves processing hundreds or thousands of output files, extracting relevant data, and organizing results for analysis. This post-processing phase presents significant challenges that can bottleneck research productivity.

Traditional approaches to processing Gaussian output files typically involve manual extraction using text editors, simple scripts, or general-purpose tools like grep and awk. These methods become impractical when dealing with large datasets common in high-throughput screening studies, conformational analyses, or reaction mechanism investigations. Researchers often face several critical issues:

1. **Computational Bottlenecks**: Processing thousands of output files sequentially can take hours or days, significantly delaying research progress.

2. **Resource Management**: Running multiple instances of processing scripts on shared computing clusters can lead to resource conflicts, system overload, and job failures.

3. **Data Consistency**: Manual extraction methods are prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex output formats or failed calculations.

4. **Job Status Monitoring**: Identifying completed, failed, or problematic calculations across large datasets requires systematic checking that is difficult to implement reliably.

5. **High-Level Energy Calculations**: Combining results from different calculation levels (e.g., geometry optimization with single-point energy corrections) requires careful data matching and thermal correction calculations.

Gaussian-Extractor addresses these challenges by providing a unified, high-performance solution that implements parallel processing with cluster-aware resource management. The software automatically detects job scheduler environments and adjusts its behavior accordingly, ensuring safe operation in shared computing environments while maximizing processing efficiency.

# Methods

Gaussian-Extractor is implemented in modern C++20, leveraging the language's advanced features for high-performance computing [@sondak2019performance]. The software architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns, enabling maintainable code and extensible functionality.

## Software Architecture

The codebase is organized into several key modules:

**Extraction Module** (`src/extraction/`): Implements the core functionality for parsing Gaussian output files and extracting thermodynamic data, molecular coordinates, and calculation metadata. The module employs multi-threaded processing with thread-safe data structures to ensure efficient parallel operation.

**Job Management Module** (`src/job_management/`): Provides functionality for checking job completion status, identifying errors, and organizing output files based on their status. This includes detection of convergence failures, PCM issues, and imaginary frequency calculations.

**High-Level Energy Module** (`src/high_level/`): Implements sophisticated algorithms for combining thermal corrections from lower-level calculations with high-accuracy single-point energies, enabling accurate Gibbs free energy calculations using composite approaches.

**Input Generation Module** (`src/input_gen/`): Creates Gaussian input files from molecular coordinates with customizable calculation parameters and template support for different calculation types.

**User Interface Module** (`src/ui/`): Provides both command-line and interactive interfaces, with special support for Windows users including built-in Linux command equivalents.

## Parallel Processing and Resource Management

Gaussian-Extractor implements sophisticated resource management to ensure cluster-safe operation. The software automatically detects the number of available CPU cores and implements a conservative default of using half the available cores to prevent resource conflicts. Users can override this behavior through command-line options or configuration files.

The resource management system includes:

- **Memory Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage and implements limits to prevent out-of-memory conditions
- **File Size Limits**: Automatically skips oversized files (>100MB by default) to prevent processing bottlenecks
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implements signal handlers for clean termination of long-running operations
- **Cluster Detection**: Automatically identifies job scheduler environments (SLURM, PBS, SGE, LSF) and adjusts behavior accordingly

## Safety Features

The software incorporates multiple safety mechanisms designed for shared computing environments:

- **Automatic Resource Detection**: Dynamically adjusts thread count based on system load and available resources
- **Memory Management**: Implements configurable memory limits with automatic cleanup
- **File System Safety**: Uses atomic file operations and implements file locking where appropriate
- **Error Recovery**: Provides comprehensive error handling with detailed diagnostic information

# Key Features

This enables accurate Gibbs free energy calculations using state-of-the-art composite approaches [@curtiss1998gaussian; @montgomery2000gaussian] that would be difficult to implement manually.

**Job Status Monitoring**: Comprehensive job checking capabilities identify completed calculations, convergence failures, PCM issues, and imaginary frequency problems. The software automatically organizes output files into appropriate directories based on their status.
