 * @file job_checker.h
 * @brief Job status checking and file organization system for Gaussian calculations
 * @author Le Nhan Pham
 * @date 2025
 * 
 * This header defines a comprehensive job management system for organizing
 * Gaussian computational chemistry calculations based on their completion status.
 * The system can identify completed jobs, failed jobs, and specific failure types
 * like PCM convergence issues, then organize them into appropriate directories.
 * 
 * @section Job Status Categories
 * The system recognizes several job completion states:
 * - COMPLETED: Normal termination with successful results
 * - ERROR: General error termination requiring investigation
 * - PCM_FAILED: Specific PCM (Polarizable Continuum Model) convergence failure
 * - RUNNING: Job still in progress (not yet terminated)
 * - UNKNOWN: Cannot determine status from available information
 * 
 * @section File Organization
 * The job checker can automatically organize files into directories based on status:
 * - Completed jobs → "done" directory (configurable suffix)
 * - Error jobs → "errorJobs" directory  
 * - PCM failures → "PCMMkU" directory
 * - Related files (.gau, .chk) are moved together with .log files
 * 
 * @section Integration
 * The job checker integrates with the main processing system to provide:
 * - Resource-aware processing with memory and thread management
 * - Progress reporting for large job sets
 * - Detailed error reporting and statistics
 * - Thread-safe operation for concurrent job checking
